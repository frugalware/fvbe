# fvbe
This is FVBE (Frugalware Versatile Bootable Environment).
It's intended to be an all-in-one bootable environment
for users to perform installation, maintenance, system
rescue, and other tasks as the need gets discovered.

## Boot Menu
From this menu, you can change the video resolution, language, region localization,
and keyboard layout that will be in use when you boot. If you choose the `RAM` boot
entry, then the ISO will load its root filesystem into `RAM`.

## Users
The two special users are `root` and `guest`. Their passwords are both `fvbe`.
