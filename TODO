fvbe:

consider what to do about fvbe networking
consider adding locale packages namely manpages and aspell
figure out how best to integrate fwsetup
update the frugalware release via the sysupgrade hook of frugalware package
setup DM for whichever GUI mode we are using

fwsetup:

implement network install (mirror and connection)
nmconfig: make profile activation part of the main menu
add config tool for configuring DPI/PPI and other font options for freetype
look at filtering out nm devices that are unusable (nm-managed = false)
look at seeing if we can avoid having space equal to the alignment leftover at the end of the disk.

systemd escapes ' in /etc/machine-info which shells do not. look into a fix.
implement length checks on user input if there's a technical limit
make default selection of config tools match the default, if it is available.
replace my method of retrieving disk unique identifier with libblkid's API, should be in v2.23.
if libfdisk can replace our writing needs, then use that instead of running fdisk/gdisk.
see if unicode handling of GPT partition names can be fixed
test 4096 byte sector disk drive handling code in block.c
consider sorting RAID device list
implement lvm setup
implement encrypted root setup
implement extlinux bootloader support
implement gui frontend
disable tty blanking
redo how format structs are allocated
full UEFI support
look into a real fix for the nmconfig delay. sleep won't cut it long term.
